      Olivia’s Story
    </h1>

    <div class="mt-8 space-y-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      <p>
        Olivia was born with a rare form of ichthyosis — a lifelong genetic skin condition that
        affects only a small number of people worldwide. From the very beginning, she has shown a
        strength and resilience that inspires everyone around her.
      </p>

      <p>
        Olivia spent the first months of her life in hospital before she was able to come home.
        Living with ichthyosis means her skin requires constant care and protection. Everyday life
        involves ongoing routines, careful management, and adapting to challenges that many families
        never have to think about.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite this, Olivia approaches life with warmth, determination, and a smile that lights up
        the room.

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">Why For Olivia exists</h2>

      <div class="mt-4 space-y-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          For Olivia was created to raise awareness of ichthyosis and to support families who are
          living with the condition every day. Through community fundraising events and ongoing
          support, the aim is to make a meaningful difference — not just for Olivia, but for others
          affected by ichthyosis.
        </p>

        <p>
          Funds raised through For Olivia support the <strong>Ichthyosis Support Group (ISG)</strong>,
          which provides vital resources, community support, and funding for research into improved
          treatments and long-term care.
